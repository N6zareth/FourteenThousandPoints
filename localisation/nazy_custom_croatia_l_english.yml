 nazy_croatia_events.1.t:0 "Those Who Came Before"
 nazy_croatia_events.1.desc:0 "The memory of Tomislav's triumphs lingers like a half-remembered dream. From the valleys of the Drava to the mountain passes of Bosnia, his banners flew proud in the face of every foe. Hungarians and Bulgarians alike bent beneath the weight of his armies, their raids broken, their ambitions checked. For the first time, the Croats stood not as scattered tribes but as a force to be reckoned with, the master of the Balkans' uncertain frontier.\n\nIn the year of our Lord 925, the moment of recognition came. Within the walls of Split, beneath the solemn gaze of the clergy, Tomislav knelt before Pope John X. The pontiff lifted high the crown, gleaming in the light of a hundred candles, and lowered it upon the duke's brow.\n\n"...in prouintia Croatorum et Dalmatiarum finibus Tamisclao rege," he proclaimed, and in that instant the Croats entered the company of kings, their ruler anointed and their people bound together beneath Rome's blessing.\n\nOutside, the air quivered with sound. Bells tolled from every church tower, their voices mingling with the roar of the crowd. Nobles raised their banners, peasants wept with joy, and soldiers beat their shields in thunderous rhythm. The sea breeze carried the scent of incense and salt across the square, and above it all the cry rang out again and again — a chorus of triumph, echoing across the ages, whispering still of a legacy not yet fulfilled."

 nazy_croatia_events.2.t:0 "Infant Great Power"
 nazy_croatia_events.2.desc:0 "At last, the fractured lands of our realm have been drawn into a single, commanding whole. Bosnia has been brought under our crown, the Dalmatian coast secured, and the proud city of Dubrovnik shines as a beacon of prosperity within our dominion. Serbia, too, has been subdued, and with each newly developed town and province, the strength of Croatia grows deeper and more enduring.\n\nAcross the mountains and plains, the people look to our rule with renewed confidence. Merchants carry their wares under the protection of our armies, peasants labor knowing their harvests are secured, and nobles see in our government a force capable of safeguarding both tradition and power. No rival in the Balkans can deny that Croatia has become the preeminent power of the region.\n\nThe Adriatic waves crash against our shores, echoing the rhythm of a nation ascendant. From the heartlands to the coast, bells ring and banners fly high — the age of Croatian dominance has begun."

 nazy_croatia_events.3.desc:0 "[CRO.Monarch.GetTitle] [CRO.Monarch.GetName] stands in the great hall of [4750.Province.GetName], Skanderbeg's city, where stone walls echo with the murmurs of a conquered people. Before him kneel the local nobles, their heads bowed low in submission, yet their eyes burn with a defiance they dare not voice. Their oaths are spoken, but sincerity is absent — loyalty here is a fragile mask, worn only to survive the moment.\n\nThe banners of our crown hang above the hall, but the land remains restless, its warriors watching from the mountains, its cities whispering of resistance. To rule Albania directly would mean stamping out these embers of defiance with a heavy hand, binding its wealth and soldiers firmly to our cause.\n\nYet another path lies open: to grant the land to a marcher lord, who might temper Albanian pride with autonomy, turning their energies outward in our defense rather than inward in revolt.\n\nThe choice is stark, and the air in the hall is heavy with it. Will Albania be chained beneath our throne, or crowned with the mantle of a march in our service?"
