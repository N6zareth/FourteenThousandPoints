 nazy_iraq_events.1.t: "Sunni-Shia Divide"
 nazy_iraq_events.1.desc: "Iraq for the longest time has been a Shia center of learning and philosophy, but it also has been ruled by Sunni caliphates and empires for centuries. This spawned many rebellions, the first of which was the Battle of Karbala led by the sons of Imam Ali Hasan and Hussain against Mauawaia where they were massacred alongside their families, which caused the divide between Shia and Sunni theology.\n\nThe present day Iraq has been divided further by these two factions, and has splintered and weakned the nation. As Iraq marches into the modern age, the future of our country shall be decided by which of these schools of thought to follow."
