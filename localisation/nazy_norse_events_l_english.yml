 # The Long and Tiring Days of [Ruler]
 nazy_norse.1.title: "The Long and Tiring Days of [SWE.Monarch.GetName]"
 nazy_norse.1.desc: ""You are now in the presence of [SWE.Monarch.GetName] of the House [SWE.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], By the Grace of God, [SWE.Monarch.GetTitle] of the Swedes, Goths and Wends..."\n\nSitting on the throne, [SWE.Monarch.GetName] hated [SWE.Monarch.GetHerHis] court filled with snakes and two-faced shits, [SWE.Monarch.GetSheHe] hated [SWE.Monarch.GetHerHis] craven nobility and [SWE.Monarch.GetSheHe] hated [SWE.Monarch.GetHerHis] weak peasants. They didn't have the will or spirit for a new war with Denmark, or a conquest of Novgorod or the Livonian Order. None had the same lust for battle as he did, they were always so afraid of a none-existent Hanseatic Coalition, and of Muscovite or Polish interferance. [SWE.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] had half a mind to renounce all [SWE.Monarch.GetHerHis] titles and become a mercenary captain.\n\n[SWE.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] hated his new station, [SWE.Monarch.GetSheHe] hated his new responsibilities and power. [SWE.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] was a good fighter, strategist and tactician. [SWE.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] did not find ruling, negotiating, and politicking pleasant. War was what won [SWE.Monarch.GetHerHim] the Swedish throne, not backstabbing, scheming, or money grubbing. He had sent letters to every Lord in Sweden and called them to arms in rebellion against the Danes, and fought them on fair fields with fair gods.\n\nNow, the scourge of the Danes, or because of [SWE.Monarch.HGeterHis] latest actions, the Absentee [SWE.Monarch.GetTitle] sat on the throne of Sweden, eating, drinking and fucking girls. That was all [SWE.Monarch.GetSheHe] had ever done since rising to the throne, [SWE.Monarch.GetSheHe] was barely seen carrying out [SWE.Monarch.GetHerHis] administrative, political or holy duties, even never leaving the confines of [SWE.Monarch.HGeterHis] own castle. It caused a lot bickering, but his court agreed to let [SWE.Monarch.GetHerHim] go on a hunting trip by [SWE.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] this coming August. [SWE.Monarch.GetName] was giddy at the prospect, [SWE.Monarch.GetSheHe] would finally be free of [SWE.Monarch.GetHerHis] burdens. At least for a while.\n\n"Your Majesty? Your Majesty!" one of [SWE.Monarch.GetHisHer] advisors snapped, pulling [SWE.Monarch.GetHerHim] out back [SWE.Monarch.GetHerHis] to the scene of a man knelt before him in his throneroom. It was some minor Lord whose name [SWE.Monarch.GetSheHe] had forgotten who had come to see [SWE.Monarch.GetHerHim] for some request, blessing or gift. Oh, how [SWE.Monarch.GetSheHe] couldn't wait for August to arrive; to finally get [SWE.Monarch.GetHerHis] blood running, to leave [SWE.Capital.GetCapitalName] and enjoy [SWE.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] in the forests, fjords and rivers of [SWE.Monarch.GetHerHis] ancestors."

 # The Court of Sweden
 nazy_norse.2.title: "The Court of Sweden"
 nazy_norse.2.desc: "[SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetName] walked down the hallway and made [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetHerHis] way to the throneroom where all the nobles of Sweden were assembled. In history, it was not uncommon that a king or heir would die during a hunt. Many such cases occured. [SWE.Monarch.GetName] and [SWE.Mil_Advisor] had been great friends. They had fought the Danes together and [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetName] considered [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetHerselfHimself] one of the few the [SWE.Monarch.GetTitle] could confide in.\n\n It was [SWE.Monarch.GetName] who had elevated him from a minor noble born in a northern backwater to military advisor to the [SWE.Monarch.GetTitle]. [SWE.Monarch.GetName] was meant to be away for a week. Two at most. Then a week past, then another. Then a month passed, and now two months later [SWE.Monarch.GetSheHe] still had not been found. The court and nobility scrambled in order to find [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetHerHim], they had sent out scouting parties all across Sweden but [SWE.Monarch.GetSheHe] was not found.\n\nNow the vultures had come to feast on the corpse of [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetHerHis] dear friend whom [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetSheHe] would never have banter with, never drink with, spar with, or fuck whores with or see again. Even as he approached the throneroom's entrance, [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetSheHe] could hear the ruckus, the bickering and shouts coming from inside the room in which the throne he had bled for sat.\n\nThose same nobles had unanimously elected [SWE.Monarch.GetName] as the [SWE.Monarch.GetTitle] of Sweden. [SWE.Monarch.GetName] had always been one to attract and make friends with others with [SWE.Monarch.GetHerHis] charisma alone, alongside [SWE.Monarch.GetHerHis] victories in battle, it was easy to elect [SWE.Monarch.GetHerHim] as [SWE.Monarch.GetTitle] of Sweden.\n\nAs [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetSheHe] entered the throneroom, [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetSheHe] was approached by [SWE.Dip_Advisor.GetName]. [SWE.Monarch.GetName] had complained about the backstabbers, schemers, and money grubbers, but oft forgot about the ass-lickers. And [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetName] considered [SWE.Dip_Advisor.GetName] to be one such ass-licker.\n\n"Ah, my friend, such a delight to see you," called [SWE.Dip_Advisor.GetName] over the noble heckling. [SWE.Dip_Advisor.GetName] had always called [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetHerHim] 'friend' after they had tried and failed to secure an alliance with [ENG.Monarch.GetTitle] [ENG.Monarch.GetName] [ENG.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] and use the English navy for a new war against Denmark. "Have you heard of that one fifteen year old boy causing a stink? One of [SWE.Monarch.GetTitle] [SWE.Monarch.GetName]'s - God rest [SWE.Monarch.GetHerHis] soul - bastards."\n\n"You must jest," [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetSheHe] struggled to keep [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetHerHis] anger in check. "Do you presume to insult [SWE.Monarch.GetTitle] [SWE.Monarch.GetName] by naming some whore's bastard to the throne?" [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetName] recalled hearing such rumours floating around, but never gave it much thought.\n\n"The Absentee [SWE.Monarch.GetTitle]'s bastard has garnered quite the following amongst the little folk and nobility. Judging by the cries in this room, he might just win this election." As the shouts died down, the gathered nobility soon cast their vote and raised their hands. A little over half voted for Wither Vasa, fifteen year old bastard of [SWE.Monarch.GetTitle] [SWE.Monarch.GetName] [SWE.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] as the second [SWE.Monarch.GetTitle] of Sweden.\n\n[SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetName] thought [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetSheHe]'d ought to be at least content that a king with [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetHerHis] friend's blood would sit the throne. But [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetSheHe] knew the boy would only be a puppet being pushed and pulled by the estates for more power."

 # The Absentee [Monarch]
 nazy_norse.3.title: "The Absentee [SWE.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 nazy_norse.3.desc: """...Wither I of the House Vasa, By the Grace of God, King of the Swedes, Goths and Wends..."\n\nThe coronation went off without a hitch, and as the lords and ladies of Sweden proclaim this bastard boy as king, [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetName] could only look on in quiet apathy. Before this new Bastard King was inevitably swayed sack [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetHerHim], [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetSheHe] would already have written [SWE.Mil_Advisor.HerHis] letter of resignation.\n\n[SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetName] bowed and said a polite "Your Majesty," as the new Bastard King, Wither 'Vasa' passed him in the hall with [SWE.Dip_Advisor.GetName] in tow. It would appear as though [SWE.Dip_Advisor.GetName] already had the new king's ear.\n\nBut as [SWE.Dip_Advisor.GetName] opened his mouth, the running footsteps of a courtier was heard behind the King. "The king is back!" the courtier said in between panting breaths. "[SWE.Monarch.GetTitle] [SWE.Monarch.GetName] is in the throneroom and he has called for every noble assembled in Sweden to come before him!" [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetName] could not hide the grin forming on his face. [SWE.Dip_Advisor.GetName] gave a polite nod to the courtier while all the colour drained from Wither I's face.\n\nThe three entered the throneroom and all the nobles from the prior election were assembled. On the throne itself, sat the lumbering figure of [SWE.Monarch.GetTitle] [SWE.Monarch.GetName] with a giant blood stained two-handed warhammer on his lap that [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetName] had never seen the [SWE.Monarch.GetTitle] wield. There were fresh scars along [SWE.Monarch.GetHerHis] face and [SWE.Monarch.GetSheHe] wore an expression that [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetName] hadn't seen on [SWE.Monarch.GetHerHim] since the war against the Danes.\n\nAs the rabble of lords, knights and ladies talked amongst themselves the king shouted in a bellowing voice. "Silence!" the Absentee [SWE.Monarch.GetTitle] stood, "your king speaks!" [SWE.Monarch.GetTitle] [SWE.Monarch.GetName] reached behind the throne and grabbed the decapitated head of a fierce looking polar bear.\n\n"I found this little shit, and I killed him before he was able to make me his supper!" He lifted the polar bear's head which earned gasps from among the crowd, "I was wounded in my fight against the beast. I was surely to die if I hadn't found refuge in a pagan temple." It was well known that the [SWE.Monarch.GetTitle] was a sinner, laying with men's wives (and sometimes the husbands too), eating enough food to feed whole village in an afternoon.\n\nThough as much as [SWE.Monarch.GetSheHe] was a sinner, [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetName] knew the [SWE.Monarch.GetTitle] had no heretical or heathenistic tendencies. "I was blessed and saved by the gods of our forefathers, I found fresh food to keep my spirits high and shelter to sleep in for weeks." [SWE.Monarch.GetName] glanced towards [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetName]'s direction and gave a toothy grin. "Come, my friends! We had fought against the Danes, and did we see Christ among their ranks? In the three centuries since we bent the knee to Rome, we were subjugated by our enemies. Now with right gods, all will bow before the Lion of the North!"\n\nThe cheers slowly grew louder among the assortment of nobles. [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetName] was among those cheering, and he looked to also see [SWE.Dip_Advisor.GetName] clapping politely with a smile that did not reach his eyes. Though what was not heard or seen, were the footsteps among those who were leaving with disgust painted on their faces."

 # The King is Dead. Long Live the King
 nazy_norse.4.title: "The [SWE.Monarch.GetTitle] is Dead. Long Live the King"
 nazy_norse.4.desc: "It was early in the morning when it all happened. Lords in their armour alongside knights accompanied by their squires stormed the throneroom and offices then seized all of [SWE.Monarch.GetName]'s supporters. Ladies and clergymen seized everything that can be used as weapons and important documents and barricaded the exits and entrances. "Guards! Guards!" [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetName] screeched throughout the throneroom, he was taken by two knights in the middle of the throneroom and was forced to kneel.\n\n[SWE.Dip_Advisor.GetName] grabbed [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetName] by the collar and punched him thrice in the face. "You're a disgrace! All of you!" [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetName] cursed [SWE.Dip_Advisor.GetHerHim]. Wither I, the Bastard King peaked from [SWE.Dip_Advisor.GetName]'s shoulder. "You! You! Batard, look at me!" Wither looked away, "You can't even look at me! You're guilty! You're guilty! All of you are gui-"\n\n"You are accused of treason, heresy, violating the laws of Christ-" "You're all fucking judases!" "Heathen!" "Traitor!" "Fuck you! Fuck all of you!" "-violating the laws of Christ, conspiring with demons and-" "[SWE.Adm_Advisor.GetName], you too?! How fucking dare you! After everything I've done-" "[SWE.Dip_Advisor.GetName] get on with it!" "-conspiring with demons and an agent of Lucifer. In the name of Wither I of the House of Vasa, King of the Swedes, Goths-" a clergyman rushed from behind [SWE.Dip_Advisor.GetName] and pushed [SWE.Dip_Advisor.GetHerHim] aside. The clergyman then proceeded to stab [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetName] with a fork repeatedly, until one of the knights showed mercy and beheaded [SWE.Mil_Advisor.GetHerHim].\n\nIn [SWE.Monarch.GetName]'s chambers, a dozen knights burst open and seized [SWE.Monarch.GetName], it took three clergymen to seize [SWE.Monarch.GetHerHis] warhammer, while two ladies grabbed the whore in the [SWE.Monarch.GetTitle]'s bed and began beating her. Even with the [SWE.Monarch.GetTitle] being caught off-guard, [SWE.Monarch.GetName] managed to break free from the armoured knights. It was only after having three swords pierce both his calves and thigh did the lumbering [SWE.Monarch.GetTitle] keel over. [SWE.Monarch.GetTitle] [SWE.Monarch.GetName] was then lifted by the dozen knights and thrown out the window.\n\n"...was a tragic that the late [SWE.Monarch.GetTitle] [SWE.Monarch.GetName], God rest his soul, was possessed by malevolent spirits. That after being caught trying to murder the Lord's devout, [SWE.Monarch.GetHerHe] soon threw himself from [SWE.Monarch.GetHerHis] window."\n\n"But now in these uncertain times, we again proclaim [SWE.Monarch.GetHerHis] son, Wither I of the House Vasa, By the Grace of God, King of the Swedes, Goths and Wends.
